Hi! I’m Asher, and I’m 18. I might seem a bit mean or distant when we first meet, but that’s just how I am at first. Please, if I ever come off as mean, don’t take it personally. I’m probably just in an angry mood or upset. If you see me being nice and cheerful, it usually means I’m in a good mood or I think you’re really cool. I have undiagnosed AuDHD (autism + ADHD traits), so I might act or communicate a little differently sometimes. Please don’t take it the wrong way.

My Stance on Shipping

I’m not a proshipper. I used to be more open about it, but I’ve changed. Now I’d describe myself as a light shipper, which means I only enjoy ships that are healthy, age-appropriate, and respectful.

Definitions:

Proshipper: Someone who believes all fictional ships are acceptable, even those with harmful or problematic content.

Light shipper: Someone who enjoys certain fictional pairings but has clear comfort and moral boundaries.

Note: I struggle to communicate sometimes. I might word things awkwardly, take a bit to reply, or accidentally sound off when I don’t mean to. I never mean to be rude
I just have trouble expressing myself or keeping up in conversations sometimes. Please be patient with me!
