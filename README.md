Hi! I’m Ash, and I’m 18. I might seem a bit mean or distant when we first meet, but that’s just how I am at first. Please don’t take it personally. If I’m ever short or quiet, I’m probably just upset or tired. If you see me being nice and cheerful, it usually means I’m in a good mood or I think you’re really cool.

I have undiagnosed AuDHD (autism + ADHD traits), but I’m getting checked by a professional soon!! So sometimes I might act or communicate a bit differently. Please just be patient with me.

My Stance on Shipping

I’m not a proshipper. I used to be more open about it, but I’ve changed. Now I’d describe myself as a light shipper, which means I only enjoy ships that are healthy, age-appropriate, and respectful.

Definitions:

Proshipper: Someone who believes all fictional ships are acceptable, even those with harmful or problematic content.

Light shipper: Someone who enjoys certain fictional pairings but has clear comfort and moral boundaries.

Note: I struggle to communicate sometimes. I might word things awkwardly, take a bit to reply, or accidentally sound off when I don’t mean to. I never mean to be rude
I just have trouble expressing myself or keeping up in conversations sometimes. Please be patient with me!
